"""
We have provided some synthetic (fake, semi-randomly generated) twitter data in a csv file named project_twitter_data.csv 
which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. We have also words 
that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment, in the files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt.

Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. 
You will create a csv file, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score 
(which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), 
and the Net Score for each tweet. At the end, you upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets, and produce a graph 
of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.

Finally, copy in your previous functions and write code that opens the file project_twitter_data.csv 
which has the fake generated twitter data (the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies 
to that tweet). Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. 
Copy the code from the code windows above, and put that in the top of this code window. Now, you will write code to create a csv file 
called resulting_data.csv, which contains the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are 
in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score (how positive or negative the text is 
overall) for each tweet. The file should have those headers in that order. Remember that there is another component to this project. 
You will upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.
