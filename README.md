Use TasteDive to get related movies for a whole list of titles. Youâ€™ll combine the resulting lists of related movies, and sort them according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores (which will require making API calls to the OMDB API.) To fetch data from TasteDive, the documentation for the API is at https://tastedive.com/read/api.
